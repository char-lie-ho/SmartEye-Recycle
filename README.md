## 1. Project Description
SmartEye is a web-based web application designed to assist and simplify the recycling process for residents in Vancouver to streamline the process of recycling. Instead of using text-based search (although we also include this feature!), we provide another option through the use of barcode recognition. In addition, we also build a review system for the recycling facilities, displaying facility locations on a map, setting recycling reminders and even allowing users to personalize the application by modifying their profile pictures!

## 4. Complete setup/installion/usage
State what a user needs to do when they come to your project.  How do others start using your code or application?
Here are the steps ...
1. Create a new account by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password.
2. Try the barcode scanning feature to quickly obtain information about any item's recyclability.
3. Alternatively, users can use the text-search function to search for recycling information by typing keywords.
4. Access the facility page to view nearby or favourite recycling facilities. 
5. Select a recycling facility from the list or map and get directions to reach the chosen location.
6. Users can contribute to the community by writing reviews about their experiences with recycling facilities.
7. Users may choose to set up recycling reminder alarms for scheduled recycling activities.
8. Optionally, users can personalize their accounts by uploading profile pictures and editing personal information.

## 5. Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs:
* The barcode database is limited and primarily intended for testing purposes
* The text-based search is limited to precise wordings for effective searches 
* The recycling reminder is not able to send any notification to users
* The nearby facilities are not able to show the nearest facilities based users location
* The recycling information database is not fully completed 


## 6. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* Fully implement the recycling reminder features
* Enhance the recycling information in the database
* Use another library for barcode reading to improve scanning functionality
