# Summary: üìÉ
SmartEye is a web-based web application designed to assist and simplify the recycling process for residents in Vancouver to streamline the process of recycling. Instead of using text-based search (although we also include this feature!), we provide another option through the use of barcode recognition. In addition, we also build a review system for the recycling facilities, displaying facility locations on a map, setting recycling reminders and even allowing users to personalize the application by modifying their profile pictures!

### üëâ [Go to the deployed website](https://smart-eye-app.web.app/)
